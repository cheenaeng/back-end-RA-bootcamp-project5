## About 
KopiRAcoon is a coffee app that aims to help people order coffee(kopi) in their favorite proportion in Singapore. Singapore has a strong coffee culture and the naming of coffee is largely influenced by a myriad of dialects which may be confusing for non-locals or even the younger generation who are slowly losing touch with their native dialects.
